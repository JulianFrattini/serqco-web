# SERQco: Software Engineering Research Quality Coalition

## 1 Mission

Background: The Software Engineering Research Quality Coalition
(SERQco, pronounced “Sirco”) works based on the perception that many
em-pirical SE research contributions have (some aspects of) avoidably
low quality.  
Objective: SERQco creates evidence of research quality issues and
makes suggestions how to improve.  
Method: SERQco operationalizes reasonable lower bounds for some
aspects of research qual-ity and then measures research quality over
many published empirical SE research articles.


## 2 Methods

### 2.1 Research approach

SERQco mostly analyzes published research literature, 
using methods that work with qualitative data but aim at quantitative results.
A common approach for simple cases is open coding plus 
subsequent content analysis. 
More complicated cases will use individually crafted combinations of methods.

### 2.2 Epistemological stance

In the normative aspects of its work, 
SERQco predominantly uses pragmaticist and 
mildly antipositivist epistemological stances.

### 2.3 Organization

SERQco is a 
[loose collective of SE researchers](members)
who work together on a project-by-project basis.
A project usually aims at doing a single study and producing 
one or two publications from it.

### 2.4 Open science

SERQco works transparently: 
We identify each analyzed article clearly and publish raw data. 
This will embarrass some authors, but our research is about works, not people, 
and is interested in general trends, not in individual cases 
(which we may still use for illustration).

## 3 Possible topics

There are many questions that SERQco might tackle. 
Some are straightforward to investigate and the results should be 
acceptable for everybody; 
others will be trickier or the outcomes more controversial. 
SERQco considers them all and picks those where the benefit ratio
appears  favorable.

Examples (in order of increasing difficulty):
 - Abstracts that do not summarize
 - Conclusions that do not draw conclusions
 - Confusing engineering with science: not explaining relevance
 - Use of causational language in studies that are merely correlational
 - Imprecise method descriptions
 - Questionable tacit assumptions

## 4 The logo: “Defining a bar”?

In some countries, “bar” is a legal term referring to the community of 
legal practitioners and 
connoting the line in a courtroom that separates the spectators 
from the participants of a trial;  
the “bar exam” is an examination that people with a university legal degree
need to pass to become members of the bar and be admitted to court
or at least to higher courts.

In this spirit, SERQco will demonstrate some conditions 
that an SE research article should fulfill before it can be considered
good research.
